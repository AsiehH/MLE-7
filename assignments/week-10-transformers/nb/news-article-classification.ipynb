The independent attention outputs are then concatenated and linearly transformed into the expected dimension. Intuitively, multiple attention heads allows for attending to parts of the sequence differently (e.g. longer-term dependencies versus shorter-term dependencies).\n","\n","## Interview Readiness\n","- What is the main idea behind Positional Encoding?\n","    - The Transformer architecture ditched the recurrence mechanism in favor of multi-head self-attention mechanism. As each word in a sentence simultaneously flows through the Transformer’s encoder/decoder stack, The model itself doesn’t have any sense of position/order for each word. Consequently, there’s still the need for a way to incorporate the order of the words into our model. One possible solution to give the model some sense of order is to add a piece of information to each word about its position in the sentence. We call this piece of information, the positional encoding.\n","\n","\n","- What is EarlyStopping and why do we use it?\n","  - Early stopping is a method that allows you to specify an arbitrary large number of training epochs and stop training once the model performance stops improving on a hold out validation dataset.\n","\n","- How would you explain what a transformer model is to business stakeholders (at a high level)?\n","\n","  - A transformer model is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like the words in this sentence. It applies an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called attention or self-attention, to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other. They are more computationally efficient than LSTMs because they do not use RNNs.
